# Snowplow MoEngage Tag for Google Tag Manager Server-side
## Snowplow MoEngage Tag for Google Tag Manager Server-side Overview

A Google Tag Manager Server-side Tag template for sending events from the Snowplow Client (and other GTM SS Clients) to MoEngage.

This Tag allows you to forward events in your Google Tag Manager Server container to a MoEngage REST API Endpoint.

**Works best with the [Snowplow Client][snowplow-client].**

## Event Data

This Tag reads event data from the "Common Event Data" specified in the [Google Tag Manager documentation][gtm-event-docs] and also populates a number of properties from the rich Snowplow events generated by the [Snowplow JavaScript Tracker][javascript-tracker] in the browser and collected in the [GTM SS Snowplow Client][snowplow-client].

## Installation

_The server Docker image must be 2.0.0 or later._
